Game jams have been an interesting experience to pick up. I've been using the experience of partaking
in the creation of these games as an opportunity to pick up various game engines and languages.

As a bit of a brief, if you're not entirely aware of what game jams entail - they're a community-driven
experience where a large number of people agree to a time constraint to create games, and afterwards
review one another's creations to learn and grow.
